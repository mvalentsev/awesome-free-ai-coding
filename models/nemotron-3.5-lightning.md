## Who serves it free

### [opencode](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/opencode/)

🤖 Coding agents & CLIs · no card · verified 2026-10-05 · listed since 2026-08-14

Open-source coding agent whose opencode Zen gateway prices a rotating set of models at zero — inside OpenCode only, no sign-in; any provider via BYOK

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: Free models work only inside OpenCode; other clients receive `403 FreeTierError: OpenCode's free tier can only be used from within OpenCode`. The maintainer says "You cannot use the free tier in other harnesses (this is only a limitation for the free tier nothing else)". Inside OpenCode, use `opencode/<model-id>` and select the Free variant; plain muse-spark-1.3 is paid. No numerical usage quota is published. Offers rotate and each named free offer is "available on OpenCode for a limited time". For the free models, "collected data may be used to improve the model"; NVIDIA-backed offers are "Trial use only — do not submit personal or confidential data". Muse Spark Contributor is discounted "in exchange for permission to use your prompts and completions to train future Meta models", and max effort is "Standard-tier `muse-spark-1.3` only".

### [OpenRouter (free models)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/openrouter-free/)

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · no card · verified 2026-10-05 · listed since 2026-09-24

One API key for a rotating set of :free model variants, open-weight and stealth models among them

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 50 requests/day; 20 requests/minute per account

1,000 requests/day per account (after 10 credits purchased all-time)

OpenRouter's FAQ says its free models "have low rate limits" and "are usually not suitable for production use", and its limits page warns that a negative credit balance can produce errors "including for free models" and that a 429 can come from the upstream provider rather than the platform (read 2026-09-27) The docs define the daily counter as "Free-model requests recorded so far in the current UTC day". The higher daily ceiling is granted "starting one credit below the table’s threshold" to absorb rounding and top-up fees.

Open-source VS Code / JetBrains / CLI agent whose $0 plan routes "Auto Free" to the models the Kilo Gateway marks free; the same gateway serves them to any OpenAI client without a key, with BYOK and local models alongside

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 200 requests/hour per IP

$0 a month; no account for the free lane.  The lane is whatever the gateway marks isFree and the free-model lineup rotates. It costs something other than money: every free id carries mayTrainOnYourPrompts, which almost no metered id does. Auto Free routes over the free models the catalog's autoRouting list names. Everything else runs on pay-as-you-go credits or a Kilo Pass subscription. Read 2026-09-21

OpenAI-compatible router with free models beside a metered catalog, routing, caching and fallbacks

### [NVIDIA NIM (build.nvidia.com)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/nvidia-nim/)

🔌 LLM APIs with free tier · no card · not offered in Russia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and 11 more places · verified 2026-10-05 · listed since 2026-09-24

Free endpoints for the models build.nvidia.com marks "Free Endpoint", open-weight models from several labs among them, called with a free NVIDIA Developer Program key at integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1 (OpenAI-compatible)

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: No card; the API key needs a free NVIDIA Developer Program account verified by a code sent to your phone, and on 2026-09-25 build.nvidia.com's own list kept fourteen countries out of that step: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania and Uzbekistan. The ceiling is a rate, not credits: NVIDIA's site puts it at "Up to 40 rpm" and "10,000 requests per day", adding that "Rate limits may vary by model and traffic from other users may cause throttling"; NVIDIA staff call 40 RPM "the published free-tier cap" that "is not adjustable on a per-account basis". A key can also be issued and still not answer: since June 2026 the vendor's forum has carried thread after thread of new personal keys that list the catalog and get 404 on every chat call, and NVIDIA's pinned note on account access says verification "has been challenging for both the community and NVIDIA", sending such cases to help@build.nvidia.com. Each model's page states whether its free endpoint is available or deprecated, and NVIDIA renames ids without notice, so copy them from the catalog. Read 2026-09-25

One OpenAI-compatible gateway over 800+ models, dozens of which the platform prices at 0 and subsidises itself, with an Anthropic-format /v1/messages too, so a free id can back Claude Code

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: MiMo V2.6 Flash/Pro: 100 requests/day; 5 requests/minute; 1,000,000 tokens/day per account per model

per-model caps, spelled out in each model's catalog description: the newest coding routes — GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, Kimi K3 and MiMo V2.5 among them — are "limited to 5 requests per minute, 100 requests per day, and 1 million tokens per day", others such as GLM-4.7, MiniMax M3 and kimi-for-coding allow 500 requests a day on the same caps, and the rest of the lane names no figure (read 2026-09-21); the vendor states the quotas reset daily with no trial expiry and no payment method on file. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a guardrail classifier, and of lfm-2.5-2.6b-free the catalog says "the developer advises against using this model for agentic coding tasks". Every free id carries a -free suffix and the paid twin beside it is metered at list rates
