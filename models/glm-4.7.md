# Where glm-4.7 is free

It measures **notable**: in the upper half of the [Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/glm-4-7), below its strong bar.

One OpenAI-compatible gateway over 800+ models, dozens of which the platform prices at 0 and subsidises itself, with an Anthropic-format /v1/messages too, so a free id can back Claude Code

- Limits, in the vendor's words: per-model caps, spelled out in each model's catalog description: the newest coding routes — GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, Kimi K3 and MiMo V2.5 among them — are "limited to 5 requests per minute, 100 requests per day, and 1 million tokens per day", others such as GLM-4.7, MiniMax M3 and kimi-for-coding allow 500 requests a day on the same caps, and the rest of the lane names no figure (read 2026-09-21); the vendor states the quotas reset daily with no trial expiry and no payment method on file. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a guardrail classifier, and of lfm-2.5-2.6b-free the catalog says "the developer advises against using this model for agentic coding tasks". Every free id carries a -free suffix and the paid twin beside it is metered at list rates
