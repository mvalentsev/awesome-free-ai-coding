One OpenAI-compatible gateway over 800+ models, dozens of which the platform prices at 0 and subsidises itself, with an Anthropic-format /v1/messages too, so a free id can back Claude Code

<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 100/day coding routes: 5 requests/minute; 100 requests/day; 1,000,000 tokens/day per account per model; for `xiaomi-mimo-v2.6-pro-free`, `coding-glm-5.3-flash-free`, `coding-glm-5.3-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2.6-flash-free`, `coding-glm-5.2-free`, `coding-kimi-k3-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2-omni-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2.5-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2.5-pro-free`, `coding-glm-5.1-free`, `coding-minimax-m2.7-free`, `coding-glm-5-free`, `coding-glm-5-turbo-free`, `coding-minimax-m2.5-free`

500/day coding routes: 5 requests/minute; 500 requests/day; 1,000,000 tokens/day per account per model; for `coding-minimax-m3-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2-pro-free`, `glm-4.7-flash-free`, `coding-glm-4.7-free`, `k2.6-code-preview-free`, `coding-minimax-m2.1-free`, `kimi-for-coding-free`, `coding-glm-4.6-free`, `coding-minimax-m2-free`

Other free routes: Usage allowance: amount not published (period not published); scope not published; for `agents-a1-free`, `union-alpha-free`, `intern-s2-free`, `dots-3-note-preview-free`, `hy3-free`, `minimax-m2.7-free`, `lfm-2.5-2.6b-free`, `ling-3.0-tiny-free`, `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`, `ling-3.0-flash-free`, `nemotron-nano-9b-v2-free`, `nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl-free`, `nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b-free`, `nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning-free`, `nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b-free`, `north-mini-code-free`, `laguna-xs-2.1-free`, `laguna-s-2.1-free`, `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b-free`, `mimo-v2-flash-free`

Free IDs end in -free; paid twins are metered at list prices. The daily request and token caps are independent per account and model, rather than a pool to split across models. Exact IDs for each published cap appear above; the remaining routes have no numerical budget published. Daily quotas have no trial expiry or payment-method requirement. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a classifier; the lfm-2.5-2.6b-free developer advises against agentic coding use.

### [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (DashScope, international)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/alibaba-model-studio/)

🔌 LLM APIs with free tier · no card · not offered in mainland China · verified 2026-10-08 · listed since 2026-09-30

A million free tokens on each of its chat models in the Singapore region — Qwen, DeepSeek and GLM among them — valid 90 days from activation or the model's release; OpenAI-compatible

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: Typical signup grant: 1,000,000 tokens once per account per model (Valid for 90 days from activation, model release or approval, whichever is later)

Free grants apply in Singapore (international) only, independently per model and dated snapshot. The model pricing tables decide eligibility: Kimi has no free-quota column and glm-5.2-fast-preview has none. Account information must be completed before activation. After the grant, usage is automatically billed pay-as-you-go unless Free Quota Only is enabled separately for the model; that switch is disabled by default.

### [Regolo AI](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/regolo/)

🎁 Trials (no card when possible) · no card · verified 2026-10-08 · listed since 2026-09-22

EU (Italian) zero-retention inference; a month of full model access on a daily token allowance, no card

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 30-day trial: 1,000,000 tokens/day per account

"Start your 30-day free trial ... No credit card required, no commitment": the trial card names "1 month duration" ("Full access for 30 days, then choose a plan"), and "Stricter rate limits" with "Fair usage throttling applies", against "All Core Models", which on the same page is every chat model in the library table (each marked Included under Core). Nothing survives the 30 days — the page names no grant after it, only paid plans — and the daily figure is the only number the trial publishes. One model is priced at €0.00 in and out outside any trial, brick-v1-beta, and it is not one to code with: its own page calls it "a lightweight prompt-complexity classifier designed for LLM routing pipelines", a Qwen3.5-0.8B LoRA that labels a prompt easy, medium or hard for Regolo's Brick router (read 2026-09-21)
