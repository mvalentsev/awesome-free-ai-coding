# Where glm-5.1 is free

**3 rows on the list serve `glm-5.1` free:** AIHubMix (free models), Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (DashScope, international) and FreeInference (Harvard SEAS). None asks for a card. The published offers were checked on 2026-10-08 and are rechecked twice a week. It measures **notable**: in the upper half of the [Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/glm-5-1), below its strong bar.

<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 100/day coding routes: 5 requests/minute; 100 requests/day; 1,000,000 tokens/day per account per model; for `xiaomi-mimo-v2.6-pro-free`, `coding-glm-5.3-flash-free`, `coding-glm-5.3-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2.6-flash-free`, `coding-glm-5.2-free`, `coding-kimi-k3-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2-omni-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2.5-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2.5-pro-free`, `coding-glm-5.1-free`, `coding-minimax-m2.7-free`, `coding-glm-5-free`, `coding-glm-5-turbo-free`, `coding-minimax-m2.5-free`

500/day coding routes: 5 requests/minute; 500 requests/day; 1,000,000 tokens/day per account per model; for `coding-minimax-m3-free`, `xiaomi-mimo-v2-pro-free`, `glm-4.7-flash-free`, `coding-glm-4.7-free`, `k2.6-code-preview-free`, `coding-minimax-m2.1-free`, `kimi-for-coding-free`, `coding-glm-4.6-free`, `coding-minimax-m2-free`

Other free routes: Usage allowance: amount not published (period not published); scope not published; for `agents-a1-free`, `union-alpha-free`, `intern-s2-free`, `dots-3-note-preview-free`, `hy3-free`, `minimax-m2.7-free`, `lfm-2.5-2.6b-free`, `ling-3.0-tiny-free`, `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`, `ling-3.0-flash-free`, `nemotron-nano-9b-v2-free`, `nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl-free`, `nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b-free`, `nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning-free`, `nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b-free`, `north-mini-code-free`, `laguna-xs-2.1-free`, `laguna-s-2.1-free`, `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b-free`, `mimo-v2-flash-free`

Free IDs end in -free; paid twins are metered at list prices. The daily request and token caps are independent per account and model, rather than a pool to split across models. Exact IDs for each published cap appear above; the remaining routes have no numerical budget published. Daily quotas have no trial expiry or payment-method requirement. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a classifier; the lfm-2.5-2.6b-free developer advises against agentic coding use.

### [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (DashScope, international)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/alibaba-model-studio/)

🔌 LLM APIs with free tier · no card · not offered in mainland China · verified 2026-10-08 · listed since 2026-09-25

A million free tokens on each of its chat models in the Singapore region — Qwen, DeepSeek and GLM among them — valid 90 days from activation or the model's release; OpenAI-compatible

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: Typical signup grant: 1,000,000 tokens once per account per model (Valid for 90 days from activation, model release or approval, whichever is later)

Free grants apply in Singapore (international) only, independently per model and dated snapshot. The model pricing tables decide eligibility: Kimi has no free-quota column and glm-5.2-fast-preview has none. Account information must be completed before activation. After the grant, usage is automatically billed pay-as-you-go unless Free Quota Only is enabled separately for the model; that switch is disabled by default.
