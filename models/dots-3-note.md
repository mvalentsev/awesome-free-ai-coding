## Who serves it free

### [OpenRouter (free models)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/openrouter-free/)

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · no card · verified 2026-10-05 · listed since 2026-09-24

One API key for a rotating set of :free model variants, open-weight and stealth models among them

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 20 requests per minute on any :free id, 50 requests per day, and 1,000 per day once the account has purchased at least 10 credits all-time. The quota figures are published in the limits page's JavaScript data. OpenRouter's FAQ says its free models "have low rate limits" and "are usually not suitable for production use", and its limits page warns that a negative credit balance can produce errors "including for free models" and that a 429 can come from the upstream provider rather than the platform (read 2026-09-27)

### [Kilo Code](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/kilo-code/)

🤖 Coding agents & CLIs · no card · not offered in Iran, Syria, Cuba and 1 more place · verified 2026-10-05 · listed since 2026-09-24

Open-source VS Code / JetBrains / CLI agent whose $0 plan routes "Auto Free" to the models the Kilo Gateway marks free; the same gateway serves them to any OpenAI client without a key, with BYOK and local models alongside

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: $0 a month, and no account for the free lane: "The gateway allows unauthenticated access for free models only. Anonymous requests are identified by IP address and are subject to rate limiting (200 requests per hour per IP)". The lane is whatever the gateway marks isFree and the free-model lineup rotates. It costs something other than money: every free id carries mayTrainOnYourPrompts, which almost no metered id does. Auto Free routes over the free models the catalog's autoRouting list names. Everything else runs on pay-as-you-go credits or a Kilo Pass subscription. Read 2026-09-21

### [AIHubMix (free models)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/aihubmix/)

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · no card · verified 2026-10-05 · listed since 2026-09-24

One OpenAI-compatible gateway over 800+ models, dozens of which the platform prices at 0 and subsidises itself, with an Anthropic-format /v1/messages too, so a free id can back Claude Code

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: per-model caps, spelled out in each model's catalog description: the newest coding routes — GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, Kimi K3 and MiMo V2.5 among them — are "limited to 5 requests per minute, 100 requests per day, and 1 million tokens per day", others such as GLM-4.7, MiniMax M3 and kimi-for-coding allow 500 requests a day on the same caps, and the rest of the lane names no figure (read 2026-09-21); the vendor states the quotas reset daily with no trial expiry and no payment method on file. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a guardrail classifier, and of lfm-2.5-2.6b-free the catalog says "the developer advises against using this model for agentic coding tasks". Every free id carries a -free suffix and the paid twin beside it is metered at list rates
