## Who serves it free

### [opencode](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/opencode/)

🤖 Coding agents & CLIs · no card · last probe 2026-11-09 · listed since 2026-11-10

Open-source coding agent whose opencode Zen gateway prices a rotating set of models at zero — inside OpenCode only, no sign-in; any provider via BYOK

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: Free model usage: Usage allowance: amount not published (period not published); scope not published

Free models work only inside OpenCode; other clients receive `403 FreeTierError: OpenCode's free tier can only be used from within OpenCode`. Use `opencode/<model-id>` and select the Free variant. Offers rotate; each named free offer is "available on OpenCode for a limited time". Collected free-model data may improve models; NVIDIA offers are trial-only and exclude personal or confidential data. Flint 40B Free allows training and retains data for 30 days. Beam Free's provider does not train on inputs and retains them for 30 days; its listed territorial exclusions include Russia. Inkling 2 Small Free permits training. It has model-specific territorial exclusions, including Russia. LongCat 2.5 Free is hosted in China; its provider does not train on inputs or retain them.

### [OpenRouter (free models)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/openrouter-free/)

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · no card · last probe 2026-11-09 · listed since 2026-11-10

One API key for a rotating set of :free model variants, open-weight and stealth models among them

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 50 requests/day; 20 requests/minute per account

1,000 requests/day per account (after 10 credits purchased all-time)

OpenRouter's FAQ says its free models "have low rate limits" and "are usually not suitable for production use", and its limits page warns that a negative credit balance can produce errors "including for free models" and that a 429 can come from the upstream provider rather than the platform (read 2026-09-27). The docs define the daily counter as "Free-model requests recorded so far in the current UTC day". The higher daily ceiling is granted "starting one credit below the table’s threshold" to absorb rounding and top-up fees.

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · no card · last probe 2026-11-09 · listed since 2026-11-09

OpenAI-compatible model gateway with zero-priced routes and an Anthropic-format endpoint for coding clients

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: Free IDs end in -free; paid twins are metered at list prices. The daily request and token caps are independent per account and model, rather than a pool to split across models. Published caps apply to their named model IDs; the remaining routes have no numerical budget published. Request limits and campaign durations apply to their named IDs. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a classifier; the lfm-2.5-2.6b-free developer advises against agentic coding use.
