# Where diffusiongemma is free

**2 rows on the list serve `diffusiongemma` free:** NVIDIA NIM (build.nvidia.com) and FreeInference (Harvard SEAS). None asks for a card. A live probe confirmed each one on 2026-09-24 and reads them again twice a week.

## Who serves it free

### [NVIDIA NIM (build.nvidia.com)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/nvidia-nim/)

🔌 LLM APIs with free tier · no card · verified 2026-09-24 · listed since 2026-09-24

Free endpoints for the models build.nvidia.com marks "Free Endpoint", open-weight models from several labs among them, called with a free NVIDIA Developer Program key at integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1 (OpenAI-compatible)

- Limits, in the vendor's words: No card; the API key needs a free NVIDIA Developer Program account verified by a code sent to your phone, and on 2026-09-25 build.nvidia.com's own list kept fourteen countries out of that step: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania and Uzbekistan. The ceiling is a rate, not credits: NVIDIA's site puts it at "Up to 40 rpm" and "10,000 requests per day", adding that "Rate limits may vary by model and traffic from other users may cause throttling"; NVIDIA staff call 40 RPM "the published free-tier cap" that "is not adjustable on a per-account basis". A key can also be issued and still not answer: since June 2026 the vendor's forum has carried thread after thread of new personal keys that list the catalog and get 404 on every chat call, and NVIDIA's pinned note on account access says verification "has been challenging for both the community and NVIDIA", sending such cases to help@build.nvidia.com. Each model's page states whether its free endpoint is available or deprecated, and NVIDIA renames ids without notice, so copy them from the catalog. Read 2026-09-25

### [FreeInference (Harvard SEAS)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/freeinference/)

🔌 LLM APIs with free tier · no card · verified 2026-09-24 · listed since 2026-09-24

Harvard SEAS's MadSys Lab serving open models — DeepSeek V4 Flash, GLM-5.1, GLM 5.3 Flash, MiniMax M3, Qwen3.6 35B — free to every account behind both an OpenAI-shaped and an Anthropic-shaped endpoint, with a documented Claude Code setup

- Limits, in the vendor's words: No quota figure is published: the landing page says "Free to use", "No credit card required" and "Generous quota for research and prototyping", and the terms say "Quotas, rate limits, model access, and usage limits may change based on usage, demand, infrastructure capacity, abuse prevention, operational needs, and individual or aggregate activity". It is "an experimental research service", and prompts are not private: "All prompts and responses may be logged for research purposes" and "sanitized prompts and responses, usage statistics, and routing metrics — may be published or open-sourced". The models page splits the catalog: "Free accounts can use models marked Free. Models marked Pro require a Pro-enabled key" — seven chat ids Free and three Pro (glm-5.2, glm-5.3, kimi-k2.7-code), read 2026-09-05
