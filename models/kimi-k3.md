# Where kimi-k3 is free

**2 rows on the list serve `kimi-k3` free:** NVIDIA NIM (build.nvidia.com) and AIHubMix (free models). None asks for a card. A live probe confirmed each one on 2026-09-24 and reads them again twice a week. It measures **strong**: within 25 points of the top of the [Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/kimi-k3).

## Who serves it free

### [NVIDIA NIM (build.nvidia.com)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/nvidia-nim/)

🔌 LLM APIs with free tier · no card · not offered in Russia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and 11 more places · verified 2026-09-24 · listed since 2026-09-22

Free endpoints for the models build.nvidia.com marks "Free Endpoint", open-weight models from several labs among them, called with a free NVIDIA Developer Program key at integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1 (OpenAI-compatible)

- Limits, in the vendor's words: No card; the API key needs a free NVIDIA Developer Program account verified by a code sent to your phone, and on 2026-09-25 build.nvidia.com's own list kept fourteen countries out of that step: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania and Uzbekistan. The ceiling is a rate, not credits: NVIDIA's site puts it at "Up to 40 rpm" and "10,000 requests per day", adding that "Rate limits may vary by model and traffic from other users may cause throttling"; NVIDIA staff call 40 RPM "the published free-tier cap" that "is not adjustable on a per-account basis". A key can also be issued and still not answer: since June 2026 the vendor's forum has carried thread after thread of new personal keys that list the catalog and get 404 on every chat call, and NVIDIA's pinned note on account access says verification "has been challenging for both the community and NVIDIA", sending such cases to help@build.nvidia.com. Each model's page states whether its free endpoint is available or deprecated, and NVIDIA renames ids without notice, so copy them from the catalog. Read 2026-09-25

### [AIHubMix (free models)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/aihubmix/)

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · no card · verified 2026-09-24 · listed since 2026-09-16

One OpenAI-compatible gateway over 800+ models, dozens of which the platform prices at 0 and subsidises itself — GLM-5.3 and Kimi K3 coding routes among them — with an Anthropic-format /v1/messages too, so a free id can back Claude Code

- Limits, in the vendor's words: per-model caps, spelled out in each model's catalog description: the newest coding routes — GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, Kimi K3 and MiMo V2.5 among them — are "limited to 5 requests per minute, 100 requests per day, and 1 million tokens per day", others such as GLM-4.7, MiniMax M3 and kimi-for-coding allow 500 requests a day on the same caps, and the rest of the lane names no figure (read 2026-09-21); the vendor states the quotas reset daily with no trial expiry and no payment method on file. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a guardrail classifier, and of lfm-2.5-2.6b-free the catalog says "the developer advises against using this model for agentic coding tasks". Every free id carries a -free suffix and the paid twin beside it is metered at list rates
