## Who serves it free

### [OpenRouter (free models)](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/openrouter-free/)

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · no card · last probe 2026-10-15 · listed since 2026-09-24

One API key for a rotating set of :free model variants, open-weight and stealth models among them

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Provider-wide limits</summary>

- Limits, in the vendor's words: 50 requests/day; 20 requests/minute per account

1,000 requests/day per account (after 10 credits purchased all-time)

OpenRouter's FAQ says its free models "have low rate limits" and "are usually not suitable for production use", and its limits page warns that a negative credit balance can produce errors "including for free models" and that a 429 can come from the upstream provider rather than the platform (read 2026-09-27). The docs define the daily counter as "Free-model requests recorded so far in the current UTC day". The higher daily ceiling is granted "starting one credit below the table’s threshold" to absorb rounding and top-up fees.

Free IDs end in -free; paid twins are metered at list prices. The daily request and token caps are independent per account and model, rather than a pool to split across models. Published caps apply to their named model IDs; the remaining routes have no numerical budget published. Request limits and campaign durations apply to their named IDs. nemotron-3.5-content-safety-free is a classifier; the lfm-2.5-2.6b-free developer advises against agentic coding use.

### [Vercel AI Gateway](https://mvalentsev.github.io/awesome-free-ai-coding/providers/vercel-ai-gateway/)

🧭 Aggregators (one key, many providers) · card required · last probe 2026-10-15 · listed since 2026-08-14

OpenAI-compatible model gateway with $5 of monthly credit after adding a payment method, plus separate zero-priced model routes

- Limits, in the vendor's words: Gateway credit: $5/month per team

Zero-priced model routes: Usage allowance: amount not published (period not published) per team

A team must add a valid payment method before using free credit; otherwise requests return `403 customer_verification_required`. Credit spends at provider list rates, has lower per-model rate limits and excludes BYOK. Buying credit ends the monthly free credit. Zero-priced model routes remain a separate free mode and do not spend that balance. Use their exact free IDs: a similarly named route without its free suffix can be metered.

Nous Research's inference portal with a $0 Free plan for :free models, accessible through an OpenAI-compatible API and Hermes Agent

- Limits, in the vendor's words: Free models: Usage allowance: amount not published (period not published) per account

Choose the Free plan and use exact :free IDs; they are zero-priced, while metered routes are outside it. A portal key is required: a keyless chat call returns 402 even though the public catalog is readable. No page read mentions a card or a numerical rate cap.
